# üèÜ Leaderboard System (AVL Tree in C++)

This project implements a **Leaderboard System** using an **AVL Tree** in C++.  
It demonstrates **self-balancing binary search trees** with leaderboard operations such as ranking, searching, and score analysis.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Insert Scores** ‚Äì Maintains balance automatically using AVL rotations  
- **Display Leaderboard**
  - Level-order traversal (hierarchical view)  
  - In-order traversal (sorted scores)  
- **Statistics**
  - Total players  
  - Minimum & Maximum scores  
  - Sum of all scores  
- **Queries**
  - Check if a score exists  
  - Print scores within a given range  
  - Count of scores greater/smaller than a value  
  - Show leaf nodes (players with no children)  
  - Find level (depth) of a score  
  - Find the k-th smallest score

## üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Demonstrated

- **AVL Tree** (Self-balancing BST)  
- **Rotations**: Left, Right, Left-Right, Right-Left  
- **Recursion** for searching, traversal, and queries  
- **Queue (STL)** for level-order traversal  
- **Dynamic Node Allocation** with cleanup handled by C++ runtime
